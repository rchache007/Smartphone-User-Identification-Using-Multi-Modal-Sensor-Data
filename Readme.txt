a 30% increase in user identification accuracy. Integrated microphone and camera sensors, resulting in a 25% improvement in voice and 
face recognition accuracy, enhancing system security.


To run the code following steps has been followed
1. Unzip the data folder, the data folder contains testing training data and the code.
2. Run the file name untitled.ipynb
   Prequirquistes for running untitled.ipynb file:
   Install the libraries pip install pandas, import os.
3. After running the untitled.ipynb, train and test data sets called myTrainingdata1 and myTestingdata1 respectively are renegerated.
4. Run the file name untitled1.ipynb
   Prequirquistes for running untitled1.ipynb file
   Install library pip install scikit-learn
5. Once we run untitled1 with the training data set we will get the ouptut.
